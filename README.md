# Distatus
Distatus is a UI based Discord status changer.

## Compiler
Distatus is built using Python and uses Pyinstaller as a compiler.

build.py is also included so if you want to compile the binary yourself you can.

## Configuration
Distatus creates two files called, status.json and config.json. These two files are used for holding the user token and the statuses that it cycles.

- TOKEN
- TIME
- Start Minimised
- Start on Logon
